      <description>Speaker: Eldad Haber (UBC)
Location: Mobify Vancouver 725 Granville St #420
Talk: 18:00 &amp;ndash; 19:00
Reception: 19:00 &amp;ndash; 20:30
Details: Visit the event listing on the PIMS website to register or obtain more information.
Description In this talk we will explore deep neural networks from a dynamical systems point of view. We will show that the learning problem can be cast as a path planning problem with PDE constraint. This opens the door to conventional Computational techniques that can speed up the learning process and avoid some of the local minima.</description>
